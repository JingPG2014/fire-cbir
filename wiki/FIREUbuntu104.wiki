#summary Step-by-step instruction to compile FIRE on Ubuntu 10.4.


To facilitate installation, I provide here a description how to compile the FIRE server on Ubuntu 10.4 from scratch

## Compiling FIRE

 * default Ubuntu 10.4 installation (in May 2010 in virtualbox) 
 * upgrade to recent state (sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade) on July 26, 2010
 * sudo apt-get install subversion g++ libmagick++-dev
 * svn checkout http://fire-cbir.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ fire-cbir
 * cd fire-cbir
 * make 

After that the bin-Directory contain a total of 47 binaries and the FIRE server is ready to use.
This does not include the integration  with the Apache webserver.
